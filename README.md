Hi! This is my work from the first 3 weeks.

## 📅 Week 2: Pandas Data Handling
* I worked with the Chipotle and User datasets to learn how to clean data tables.


## 📅 Week 3: Project Start (NLP)
* I started the Fake News Detector.
* I learned how to "scrub" text to remove links and punctuation.
* I used a Logistic Regression model to try and guess if news is fake.
